# Bot-Code-of-Conduct

This is a document for ethical practices in creative bot making. It is written as a companion resource to go along with a planned set of [Coding Train](http://thecodingtrain.com/) video tutorials related to making Twitter Bots. At the moment it is a list of guiding principles and questions to ask as part of the practice of creative bot making.

## Punch up, not down!

## Language

1. Develop a practice of filtering.
    * A simple solution is to use a word filtering module or database, for example [wordfilter](https://github.com/dariusk/wordfilter) by [@tinysubversions](https://twitter.com/tinysubversions)
    * More sophisticated methodologies should be considered, for example, [Transphobic joke detection](http://tinysubversions.com/notes/transphobic-joke-detection/) also by [@tinysubversions](https://twitter.com/tinysubversions).

2. Don't say anything you personally wouldn't say to a stranger!
> My bot is not me, and should not be read as me. But it's something that I'm responsible for. It's sort of like a child in that way—you don't want to see your child misbehave. —[@xor](https://twitter.com/xor)

3. Limit interactions!
     * One option is to block your bot from any replies or @ mentions of any kind.
     * Another option is to restrict your bot to replying to or @ mentioning only people who follow the bot ("opt-in")
     
4. Are you able to actively moderate the bot and remove postings if necessary? Would manual curation of generated content be most apporpriate for the context of your bot?
     
## Consequences
1. What is the full range of possible outputs?
     * Before you deploy, run your bot for a period of time logging the output without publishing and evaluate.
2. How might others misuse the bot?

## Voice
* Whose voice is the bot speaking with? 
* Are you able to speak with that voice from an ethical and legal standpoint?
* Can you trace the authorship of what the bot says?
* Are you able to properly credit the source data and text and the associated labor with its creation?
